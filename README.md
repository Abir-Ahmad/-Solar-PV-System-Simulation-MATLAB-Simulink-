ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project models and simulates a solar photovoltaic (PV) generation system with DCâ€“DC boost conversion and grid integration. The system is tested under varying conditions, and MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) techniques are explored for optimized power transfer.

âš¡ Features

Modeled a solar PV source with DC output (~180V).
Implemented a DCâ€“DC boost converter to raise voltage before grid integration.
Added a voltage source inverter (VSI) to supply AC to the grid.
Incorporated measurement blocks and scopes for performance tracking.
Tested MPPT control for maximizing energy extraction.
